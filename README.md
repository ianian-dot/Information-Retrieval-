# Information-Retrieval-
## Task 1: Information Retrieval and Data Mining project: Deterministic methods on finding relevant answers to queries

* Exploring text statistics with Zipf's law
  * Preprocessing text, stopword removal, term frequency
* Generating inverted word index for efficient passage retrieval
* Retrieval methods
  * Building TFIDF representation of passages via sparse matrices
  * Implementing BM25 via TFIDF
* Query Likelihood Models: Laplace, Lidstone, Dirichlet

* Challenges: finding efficient python methods to deal with large datasets (high dimensionality, large number of rows, etc)

## Task 2: Machine Learning methods on finding relevant answers to queries

* Learning-To-Rank LambdaMart model
* XGBoost
* Neural Networks
